Pull Requests
-------------

Want to add a feature or fix a bug? If it's something small, just send a pull
request. If it's something big, please get in touch and ask if I'm interested
before working on it.

I'm pretty picky about code quality and simplicity, so don't be alarmed if I
ask you to change things or just say I'm not interested. If you're offended,
maybe [a kitten](http://www.emergencykitten.com/) will help cheer you up?
