# Emergency Kitten!

[Emergency Kitten](https://www.emergencykitten.com) shows you a random kitten on every pageview. Because sometimes you just need a kitten.

## Kitten Sources

Kittens can come from two places:

1.   A small set of curated kittens that are hard-coded in `kittens.js`.

2.   A [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) search for interesting CC-licensed or public domain photos tagged with `kitten` or `kittens`.

Exactly which place a kitten comes from on any given pageview is completely random. If the Flickr API call fails for any reason, a kitten from the curated set will be used instead.

From time to time you may see a photo that doesn't contain a kitten. This just means someone mistagged it on Flickr. Sorry about that.

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to upload pictures of kittens to Flickr! At this time, we don't need any more curated kittens.

We're also not looking for new features or new data sources at this time.
